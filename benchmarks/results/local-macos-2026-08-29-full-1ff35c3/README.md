# Full local benchmark campaign — 2026-08-29

Campaign run from clean `main` at `1ff35c3` on Apple Silicon with the
`macos-native-release` build (`Release`, native CPU on, LTO off). This is local
performance evidence, not a CI baseline, a cross-platform comparison, or a
durability certification.

## Coverage

- 222/222 commands completed (`ok=218` newly measured + `skip=4` resumed from a
  short prior partial run; `fail=0`);
- core Store and Index, owner-bound/uniform/Zipf scaling at 1/2/4/8 workers;
- TCP volatile, pipeline 1/8/32/128, multi-pair and mixed workloads;
- sync/group/periodic durability, embedded and TCP paths;
- experimental paired Reactor A/B, compaction, maintenance, rotation, churn;
- 222 source files aggregated into the strict report (`results.md` /
  `results.json`).

Exact invocations are in `commands.txt`, machine record in `environment.txt`.

## Notes

- Sampling defaults to warmup 1 / repeats 7 unless a harness file states otherwise
  (generation diagnostics use warmup 3 / repeats 11).
- macOS affinity calls remain advisory/unavailable; client and server share the
  local host/process.
- Do not treat these medians as production capacity or as E3/E4 evidence.
