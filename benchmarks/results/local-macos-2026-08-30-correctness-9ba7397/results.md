## Durable pipeline profile

Queue and service values are per-sample averages; maxima are the worst observed operation across all measured samples. Commit timing is the v1 batch publication boundary and is not available for unbatched durable-sync.

| Suite | Queue avg/max | Queue peak | Store avg/max | Commit avg/max | Batch avg/max | Pending | Closes r/b/a/d | Rejected/expired/failed |
