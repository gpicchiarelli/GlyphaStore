# Persistence/recovery TLA+ model

Bounded abstract model of the persistence-v1 replacement-publication chain:

```text
Record write -> Record sync -> commit-slot write -> commit-slot sync
-> Manifest write/sync/rename -> directory sync -> crash -> recovery oracle
```

Linked requirement: `GS-PERSIST-ORDER-001`. Normative behavior remains in
[`docs/spec/persistence-v1.md`](../../../docs/spec/persistence-v1.md) and the
[`recovery-state-matrix-v1`](../../../docs/spec/recovery-state-matrix-v1.md).

The crash transition explores both permitted outcomes of an issued but incomplete write or rename.
The recovery oracle admits only the old complete authority (`MUST_NOT_EXIST`) or the new complete
authority (`MUST_EXIST`). An explicit committed-corruption transition must end fail-closed. This is
the formal counterpart of the concrete SIGKILL matrices. Weak fairness is declared only for the
three terminating recovery actions so TLC can verify that recovery reaches `ready` or `failed`; it
does not assume fairness for writes or crashes. The model does not cover filesystem, controller,
firmware, physical power loss, timing, or the full byte codecs and therefore does not raise the E2
claim ceiling or establish E3/E4.

## Run TLC

```bash
export TLA2TOOLS_JAR=/path/to/tla2tools.jar
./engineering/formal/persistence/run-tlc.sh
```

CI: `.github/workflows/formal-models.yml`. TLC errors and the bounded wall-clock timeout are
fail-closed.
