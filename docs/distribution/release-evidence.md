# Retained release evidence

Status: normative for release promotion
Schema: `engineering/schemas/release-evidence.schema.json`
Validator: `engineering/tools/release_evidence.py`

Transport receipts use `engineering/schemas/candidate-admission.schema.json` and
`engineering/schemas/evidence-import.schema.json`; their executable authority is
`engineering/tools/release_bundle.py` (`admit-candidate`, `import-evidence`, and
`validate-evidence-import`).

A filename ending in `-evidence.json` is not proof by itself. Every promoted evidence record must
bind one exact candidate seal or native package digest to the release commit and product version.
It records the CI workflow/run identity, native OS and architecture, a UTC generation time, every
mandatory check, the command used for that check, and a non-empty retained log file. Unknown fields,
local/unattested producers, missing checks, failed checks, missing logs, and subject digest drift are
rejected.

The release policy requires eight records:

| Record | Required coverage | Subject |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `abi-compatibility-evidence.json` | symbols, layout, old/new binary directions | candidate seal |
| `persistent-compatibility-evidence.json` | old fixture open/recovery and operator tools | candidate seal |
| `wire-compatibility-evidence.json` | new/new and both N−1 directions | candidate seal |
| `sdk-installed-interop-evidence.json` | source isolation plus C, C++ and six SDK rows | candidate seal |
| `security-matrix-evidence.json` | sanitizers, analysis, scans, licenses, hardening | candidate seal |
| `freebsd-package-evidence.json` | native package/service/install/recovery lifecycle | FreeBSD package |
| `openbsd-package-evidence.json` | native package/service/install/recovery lifecycle | OpenBSD package |
| `reproducibility-evidence.json` | independent rebuild and artifact comparison | candidate seal |

Log files and evidence records enter `release-manifest.json`, `SHA256SUMS`, and the verified seal.
The final attestation therefore binds both the claimed result and its retained diagnostic material.
They are accepted only after `candidate-admission.json` has recorded an exact-set verification of
the original candidate. Adding evidence before admission fails closed; adding it afterwards cannot
alter or remove any candidate member and the whole augmented set is covered by the verified seal.
The validator proves structural completeness and identity; the trusted, SHA-pinned workflow remains
responsible for actually executing the recorded commands. Manually fabricating a log or evidence
record is a supply-chain incident, not an accepted waiver mechanism.

Native FreeBSD/OpenBSD CI currently retains installed-prefix ABI logs. Those are portability and
installation signals, not the package lifecycle records above. The tag graph now has native
FreeBSD and OpenBSD package producers. Both fail closed until ports account registration markers
exist and a tagged native run retains evidence. Promotion remains blocked until ports account
registration, native package creation, service lifecycle, restart recovery, configuration
preservation, and uninstall have all succeeded on both native OSes. The native jobs generate
`distinfo` from the already sealed source archive outside that archive; committing its self-digest
into the source would be circular.

The tag-only release graph now contains a same-run `sdk-installed-evidence` job. It extracts the
sealed Linux prefix without rebuilding the engine, compiles C and C++ consumers solely through its
installed CMake/pkg-config metadata, packages every language SDK, rejects source-tree module loads,
and exercises C++, Python, Perl, Go, Ruby, and Erlang against the distributed daemon. The job emits
`sdk-installed-interop-evidence.json` through the validated evidence writer and uploads it under the
`release-input-<sha>-*` namespace consumed by the closed importer. This is implemented but not yet
retained CI evidence: it becomes proof only after a successful tagged run.

The graph also contains `persistent-compatibility-evidence`. It verifies the same candidate seal,
extracts its installed Linux prefix, and builds only a protocol probe through the installed C++
package. The daemon and the verify, migrate, backup, and repair tools always come from the candidate
archive. Four isolated runs prove open/GET, two-cycle recovery, offline Worker migration, and the
backup–restore–orphan-repair chain against the newest valid complete Store strictly older than the
candidate. `engineering/tools/persistence_fixture.py` enforces tagged provenance, exact metadata,
an annotated tag resolving to the recorded commit and `VERSION`, safe regular paths, and a closed
SHA-256 inventory. `tests/fixtures/released-stores/` currently has
no prior tagged Store, so this producer intentionally blocks; it cannot substitute codec vectors or
a candidate-created self Store for cross-release proof.

`abi-compatibility-evidence` similarly refuses a same-build substitute. The candidate builder now
packages its compiled C ABI consumer as a deterministic sealed asset. A later tag selects the newest
strictly older annotated release with the same ABI major, downloads its complete immutable asset
set, revalidates its verified seal, checksums, release manifest and release-wide policy, and verifies
the retained Sigstore bundle. It then checks the candidate symbol allowlist and layout, executes the
retained old consumer with the candidate library, and executes a newly compiled consumer with the
prior official library. Both binary directions record the actual loader resolution. The producer is
implemented but cannot pass before the first complete official release exists.

`wire-compatibility-evidence` applies the same artifact discipline to protocol v2. The candidate
builder packages the compiled reference client with a closed metadata object, protocol version,
release identity, executable digest, deterministic archive metadata, and an adjacent bound SBOM.
The release job extracts both clients and both daemons only from the candidate and the verified,
attested prior release. It then executes PUT→GET, ERASE, and NOT_FOUND in three isolated directions:
new client/new server, old client/new server, and new client/old server. This is the plain-TCP v2
baseline; it does not claim TLS-profile or cross-wire-version compatibility. The producer is
implemented but remains blocked until a complete prior official release supplies the retained old
client and server bytes.

`security-matrix-evidence` is assembled only after four independent same-tag jobs succeed. The
matrix executes the complete CTest graph under ASan+UBSan and TSan; produces and validates retained
CodeQL SARIF for C/C++, Python, Go, and GitHub Actions; runs clang-tidy, formatting, the strict
warnings-as-errors build, Trivy, Gitleaks, and dependency-license closure; and then revalidates every
candidate SPDX document plus the hardening properties of the exact distributed Linux ELF. The
aggregator verifies the externally exported candidate-seal digest before reading candidate bytes,
requires one retained success log for every mandatory check, and emits the evidence record only when
the closed matrix is complete. This producer is implemented, but it is not retained CI evidence
until a tagged run succeeds. Its subject is the Linux candidate and it does not establish native
FreeBSD/OpenBSD hardening.

`freebsd-package-evidence` first checks the external candidate-seal anchor and requires the service
account to be present in the actual FreeBSD ports `UIDs` and `GIDs` authorities. A FreeBSD 14.3 VM
generates `distinfo` from the sealed source archive, runs checksum/stage/check-plist/package, installs
the resulting `.pkg` on a clean host, verifies its file and C-ABI inventory, and exercises rc.subr
start/stop, protocol-v2 PUT/GET/ERASE, durable restart recovery, forced reinstall with modified
configuration, and uninstall with configuration/data preservation. The native package is the
evidence subject; its retained `distinfo`, logs, evidence record, and bound SPDX SBOM enter the
closed importer. The producer is implemented but intentionally fails before VM execution until the
upstream account-registration marker exists, and no native tagged result has yet been retained.

`openbsd-package-evidence` mirrors that discipline on OpenBSD 7.9. It requires
`packaging/openbsd/PORTS_ACCOUNT_REGISTERED`, copies the reference port into
`$PORTSDIR/databases/glyphastore`, generates non-circular `distinfo`, builds with `DISTDIR` and
`PACKAGE_REPOSITORY`, then `pkg_add`s the `.tgz`, checks ABI symbols on
`libglyphastore.so.${ABI_VERSION}`, and exercises `rcctl` enable/start/stop, PUT/GET/ERASE, Store
verify under `/var/glyphastore`, restart recovery, config preservation, and `pkg_delete`. Same
fail-closed residual: no account marker and no retained tagged run yet.

`reproducibility-evidence` runs on a distinct runner after the candidate seal exists. It checks out
the exact annotated tag, repeats the declared release configuration and toolchain, installs into the
same normalized layout, rebuilds the compiled ABI and wire fixtures, and regenerates exactly four
archives: source, Linux prefix, ABI consumer, and wire client. The comparison rejects a missing or
extra archive and requires equal byte size and SHA-256 for every member of that closed set. The
rebuilt archives are retained as a diagnostic CI artifact but are excluded from candidate import and
promotion. The current scope is the same `ubuntu-latest` image family and declared compiler; it is
not a cross-distribution or cross-compiler reproducibility claim.
