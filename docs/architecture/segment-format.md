# Segment and record format

## Segment

Every Segment is exactly 64 MiB. The first 4 KiB contain the explicitly encoded v1 header. Record
bytes begin at offset 4096 and are appended with 8-byte alignment. All integer fields are unsigned
little-endian values; persisted bytes are never interpreted through C++ object layout.

```text
0                    4096                                      64 MiB
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| encoded header     | Record | Record | Record | unused bytes      |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------+
```

Normal Records do not cross Segment boundaries and are limited to 1 MiB in the prototype. A future
large-object path must use explicit chunking rather than weakening this invariant.

Segment lifecycle:

```text
FREE -> ACTIVE -> SEALED -> RETIRED -> RECLAIMABLE -> FREE/deleted
```

The runtime catalog separately tracks residency, liveness, readers, dirty state, persistence, and
retirement epoch. Volatile pointers and file descriptors never appear in the persistent header.
Recovery scans only through the committed end recorded by the newest valid commit slot. Bytes
beyond that boundary are an uncommitted crash tail; invalid bytes inside it are corruption. See the
[durability and recovery contract](durability-recovery.md) for ordering and failure behavior.

### Header v1

The 4 KiB header contains a 128-byte immutable prefix and two independently checksummed 128-byte
commit slots. Bytes 384 through 4095 are reserved and must be zero in v1.

| Offset | Bytes | Field | v1 rule |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | header magic | `GLYH` (`47 4c 59 48`) |
| 4 | 2 | header format version | `1` |
| 6 | 2 | immutable prefix size | `128` |
| 8 | 2 | Segment format version | `1` |
| 10 | 2 | Record format version | `1` |
| 12 | 4 | total header size | `4096` |
| 16 | 16 | Store ID | non-zero opaque identity |
| 32 | 8 | Segment ID | non-zero |
| 40 | 4 | generation | non-zero |
| 44 | 4 | owner Worker | zero-based Worker ID |
| 48 | 4 | flags | zero in v1 |
| 52 | 4 | immutable CRC32C | computed over bytes 0–127 with this field zero |
| 56 | 72 | reserved | zero in v1 |
| 128 | 128 | commit slot 0 | slot layout below |
| 256 | 128 | commit slot 1 | slot layout below |
| 384 | 3712 | reserved | zero in v1 |

The two magic values follow the existing Record convention: the hexadecimal constants are encoded
little-endian so their bytes remain readable in a hex dump. The immutable checksum excludes commit
slots by covering exactly the first 128 bytes.

### Commit slot v1

Slot offsets below are relative to the beginning of either slot. An entirely zero slot is empty.

| Offset | Bytes | Field | v1 rule |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | commit magic | `GLYC` (`47 4c 59 43`) |
| 4 | 2 | slot format version | `1` |
| 6 | 2 | slot size | `128` |
| 8 | 8 | commit generation | non-zero and monotonic |
| 16 | 4 | committed end | 4096–67108864, 8-byte aligned |
| 20 | 2 | lifecycle state | `1` active, `2` sealed |
| 22 | 2 | flags | zero in v1 |
| 24 | 8 | committed Record count | zero only for an empty extent |
| 32 | 8 | first committed sequence | zero only for an empty extent |
| 40 | 8 | last committed sequence | zero only for an empty extent; otherwise at least first |
| 48 | 4 | slot CRC32C | computed over all 128 bytes with this field zero |
| 52 | 76 | reserved | zero in v1 |

Recovery checks each slot independently and selects the valid decoded slot with the greatest commit
generation. A torn or malformed slot may fall back to the other slot. A correctly checksummed but
unknown slot version fails closed, because silently selecting an older commit could lose data. Two
different valid slots with the same generation are corruption; identical duplicates deterministically
select slot 0.

The canonical first 384 bytes are stored in
[`tests/fixtures/segment_header_v1.hex`](../../tests/fixtures/segment_header_v1.hex). Automated tests
verify exact encoding, decoding, reserved zeros, fallback after slot corruption, version rejection,
and ambiguous-generation failure.

## Record

Record v1 has a fixed 56-byte header followed by key bytes, value bytes, and the minimum zero padding
needed for 8-byte alignment.

| Offset | Bytes | Field | v1 rule |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | Record magic | `GLYR` (`47 4c 59 52`) |
| 4 | 2 | Record format version | `1` |
| 6 | 2 | Record header size | `56` |
| 8 | 4 | total encoded size | 56–1048576, exactly the minimum 8-byte-aligned extent |
| 12 | 4 | key size | exact byte length |
| 16 | 4 | value size | exact byte length |
| 20 | 4 | Record CRC32C | computed over the complete Record with this field zero |
| 24 | 8 | sequence | Worker mutation sequence |
| 32 | 8 | key hash | deterministic full-key hash metadata |
| 40 | 8 | expiration | absolute Unix-epoch nanoseconds; zero means none |
| 48 | 2 | opcode | `1` put, `2` erase |
| 50 | 2 | value type | `1` bytes, `2` integer, `3` map, `4` lease |
| 52 | 4 | flags | opcode/type-specific flags |
| 56 | variable | key and value | exact key bytes followed by exact value bytes |
| final | 0–7 | alignment padding | zero; no over-allocation is canonical |

The checksum field is treated as zero while CRC32C is computed. Decoders validate every extent
before creating a view. Persisted bytes are never interpreted by casting them to a C++ struct. The
canonical binary-key fixture is
[`tests/fixtures/record_v1.hex`](../../tests/fixtures/record_v1.hex).

Manifest, Segment header, commit slot, and Record codecs now have exact v1 layouts and golden
fixtures. Segment creation, alternate-slot append/seal, and committed-boundary scan are described in
[durable Segment files](segment-filesystem.md). The complete on-disk system is not stable yet:
Store-level recovery, migration, and crash evidence remain required before durable mode can be
enabled. The authoritative catalog layout is in the [manifest format](manifest-format.md), and
supported reader/writer pairs are tracked in the [format compatibility matrix](format-compatibility.md).
