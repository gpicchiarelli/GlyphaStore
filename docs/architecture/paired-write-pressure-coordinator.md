Implementation note: this is a measured design, not yet a normative behavior change. ADR 0031, ADR 0032,
ADR 0037 and
`docs/spec/mutation-lifecycle.md` remain authoritative.

## Decision boundary established by measurement

The official TCP runtime already admits adjacent PUT/ERASE frames into a bounded 32-record mutation window and
treats GET as a visibility barrier. In the measured 99/1 and 95/5 workloads, every mutation formed its own Writer
batch and publication. At 90/10 with four clients, the mean was only 1.05–1.09 records. This is not primarily a
failure to drain the SPSC: a connection-local GET commonly follows the mutation and cannot pass until the
generation containing that mutation is visible.

Two attempts to wait briefly for future work increased tail latency and reduced throughput. Therefore the
coordinator must consume work that is already available; it must not manufacture pressure by delaying a volatile
single PUT.

## Inputs

The future coordinator takes one immutable snapshot after the first dequeue:

```cpp
struct PublicationPressureSnapshot {
    std::size_t queue_records;
    std::size_t queue_bytes;
    std::uint64_t oldest_age_ns;
    std::size_t completion_free_records;
    std::uint64_t foreground_read_operations;
    std::uint64_t foreground_p99_ns;
    std::size_t retired_generations;
    std::size_t merge_post_entries;
    std::uint64_t maintenance_debt_bytes;
    DurabilityMode durability;
};
```

All counters are bounded or sampled. No decision may allocate, acquire a global lock, inspect client-controlled
unbounded state, or add an Index lookup.

## Deterministic policy

For volatile mutations:

1. dequeue the first admitted mutation immediately;
2. snapshot queue and completion capacity;
3. drain only records already available, capped by 32 records, byte budget, completion capacity and the oldest
   admitted deadline;
4. close immediately when the queue is empty, a GET/barrier is waiting, completion capacity is exhausted,
   generation/merge pressure requires relief, or the publication deadline is reached;
5. build and publish one immutable generation for the drained FIFO prefix;
6. deliver one completion per mutation without changing response order.

For durable-group, the configured physical group deadline is allowed to wait because it is already part of the
durability policy. Closure must be the first of records, bytes, oldest deadline, completion capacity, shutdown,
foreground fairness, or device coordinator decision. Platform defaults remain evidence-row specific.

The decision output is explicit:

```cpp
struct PublicationDecision {
    std::size_t maximum_records;
    std::size_t maximum_bytes;
    std::uint64_t close_deadline_ns;
    bool close_now;
    bool foreground_priority;
    bool maintenance_may_advance;
};
```

Identical snapshots and configuration must produce identical decisions. Policy code is a pure function; queue
draining and publication remain in the sole Writer.

## Completion policy

The SPSC delivery itself costs tens of nanoseconds. On macOS the pipe wakeup costs roughly 0.6–1.2 us, but a
notification gate that removed about 86% of wakeups worsened p99 because completions waited behind more Reader
work. Therefore notification coalescing is not accepted as a generic policy.

Any future platform optimization must preserve this anti-lost-wakeup rule:

- a completion queued while the Reader may sleep must create an observable poller event;
- the Reader may omit a new event only while it has explicitly promised to drain the completion lane again;
- a syscall reduction is insufficient evidence if p99 or p99.9 regresses.

Linux eventfd and BSD/macOS wakeups are separate platform implementations. The macOS `EVFILT_USER` candidate
reduced direct notification time by about 18%, but consistently worsened p99/p99.9 in two seven-repeat orders;
it was removed. The pipe therefore remains the BSD/macOS baseline and Linux retains eventfd. A future retry needs
a materially different scheduling protocol and must beat tails, not merely syscall time.

ACK socket-drain coalescing is subject to the same rule. A bounded look-ahead that combined only adjacent,
already-queued completions still regressed 90/10 throughput and tail latency; immediate ACK drain therefore
remains the baseline. Reducing syscall count alone is not sufficient when the ACK participates in useful client
and connection flow control.

## Publication Builder scratch

The current implementation reuses two Writer-thread-local tracking buffers: one for the generation being built
and one for the post-cut delta during incremental merge. Each reserves the normative 32-mutation bound once and
is cleared before reuse. The scratch contains only temporary owning `shared_ptr` entries used while wiring the
immutable COW directory; the published generation owns every reachable page, block and chunk independently.

This keeps Reader ownership, epoch publication and reclamation unchanged. Two buffers are required because
current and post-cut builders can coexist. A fixed array was measured and rejected because constructing all 96
empty ownership slots on every publication regressed the release workload despite improving the isolated scope.

## Maintenance quanta

Maintenance must never reuse foreground publication batching as an implicit lock. Each shard-local quantum is
bounded by all three limits:

- maximum copied records/bytes;
- maximum elapsed time;
- foreground pressure checked between quanta.

After a quantum, maintenance yields publication authority when foreground mutations exist, a completion lane is
near capacity, foreground p99 crosses its configured threshold, or generation retirement is close to its bound.
Reclaim/capacity safety may bypass the latency suspension, but the bypass and debt must remain observable.

## Required evidence before wiring the policy

- timed distribution of queue depth and already-available records at first dequeue;
- publication build time separated from pointer publication;
- completion lane free capacity and wake/resume time;
- p1/p32/p64/p128 for 99/1, 95/5, 90/10 and RAW;
- durable group fill, close reason, queue wait and physical commit;
- maintenance/rotation publication wait with and without foreground pressure;
- ASan/UBSan, TSan, fault injection, stop/drain, disconnect and recovery campaigns.

The design does not claim that a larger average batch is always better. A larger batch is accepted only when it
comes from already queued pressure and improves throughput without violating the tail-latency and correctness
gates.
