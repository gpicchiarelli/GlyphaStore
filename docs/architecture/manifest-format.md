# Manifest format

The manifest is the authoritative durable catalog for one Store. Manifest v1 is an explicitly
encoded little-endian byte sequence with one fixed 128-byte header followed by fixed 32-byte
Segment entries. The file has no implicit padding or trailing bytes, and its CRC32C covers the
complete encoded extent.

## Header v1

| Offset | Bytes | Field | v1 rule |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | manifest magic | `GLYM` (`47 4c 59 4d`) |
| 4 | 2 | manifest format version | `1` |
| 6 | 2 | header size | `128` |
| 8 | 4 | total encoded size | exactly `128 + segment_count * 32` |
| 12 | 2 | Segment entry size | `32` |
| 14 | 2 | flags | zero in v1 |
| 16 | 16 | Store ID | non-zero and equal to every listed Segment header |
| 32 | 8 | manifest generation | non-zero and monotonic across publications |
| 40 | 4 | routing algorithm | `1` = `fnv1a64-v1`; `2` = `siphash24-v1` (ADR 0030) |
| 44 | 4 | Worker count | 1–256 and fixed after Store creation |
| 48 | 8 | routing epoch | non-zero and fixed without an explicit migration |
| 56 | 4 | Segment count | at most 1,000,000 in v1 |
| 60 | 2 | Segment format version | `1` |
| 62 | 2 | Record format version | `1` |
| 64 | 2 | Segment header format version | `1` |
| 66 | 2 | commit-slot format version | `1` |
| 68 | 8 | next Segment ID | non-zero and greater than every catalog ID |
| 76 | 4 | next Segment generation | non-zero |
| 80 | 4 | manifest CRC32C | computed over the complete file with this field zero |
| 84 | 8 | Worker hash seed | `0` for FNV; SipHash seed for `siphash24-v1` |
| 92 | 36 | reserved | zero in v1 |

The one-million-entry limit bounds v1 decoding to 32,000,128 bytes. A decoder validates the count
and checked encoded extent before allocating the catalog or the temporary checksum buffer. Unknown
required versions fail closed even when the checksum is otherwise valid.

## Segment entry v1

Entry offsets are relative to the beginning of each 32-byte entry.

| Offset | Bytes | Field | v1 rule |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | Segment ID | non-zero, unique, strictly increasing across entries |
| 8 | 4 | Segment generation | non-zero |
| 12 | 4 | owner Worker | less than the persisted Worker count |
| 16 | 2 | manifest role | `1` active, `2` sealed |
| 18 | 2 | flags | zero in v1 |
| 20 | 12 | reserved | zero in v1 |

The catalog contains exactly one active Segment for every Worker. Sealed Segments remain listed
while they are recovery sources. Retiring or deleting one requires a later manifest publication
that removes it; v1 therefore does not persist retired or reclaimable roles.

The manifest records Segment ID and generation, not a trusted path identity. The storage layer maps
those values to its canonical namespace, then verifies Store ID, Segment ID, generation, owner,
and encoded versions against the Segment header. A filename alone is never recovery authority.

## Canonical encoding and selection

Strict Segment-ID order makes the encoded catalog canonical and rejects duplicate identities without
hash-based allocation. The newest manifest is selected only from candidates that have already passed
complete decoding and invariant validation. Selection uses the greatest manifest generation. Two
different valid candidates with the same generation are corruption; identical duplicates select the
first candidate deterministically.

The canonical fixture is
[`tests/fixtures/manifest_v1.hex`](../../tests/fixtures/manifest_v1.hex). Automated tests verify exact
encoding, full-file checksum coverage, truncation and trailing-byte rejection, allocation bounds,
catalog ownership, active-Worker coverage, unknown-version failure, and publication ambiguity.

Filesystem naming, locking, temporary-file cleanup, atomic replacement, and directory synchronization
are deliberately outside this codec. The first implementation layer is documented in
[`persistence-filesystem.md`](persistence-filesystem.md); its integration remains governed by the
[durability and recovery contract](durability-recovery.md). Embedded durable recovery is implemented;
released-artifact compatibility and complete native power-loss evidence remain release gates.
Supported component combinations are listed in the [format compatibility matrix](format-compatibility.md).
