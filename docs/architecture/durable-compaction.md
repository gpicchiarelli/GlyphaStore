# Crash-safe durable compaction

This document defines the v1 compaction invariants. The current tree implements the deterministic
planner, its resource gates, a checksummed intent codec embedding both exact manifest authorities,
descriptor-relative intent publication/removal primitives, and restart recovery of an interrupted
transaction. The durable builder now prepares the replacement Index, copies, seals and revalidates
private staged outputs, then installs the intent and promotes those outputs; it also supports
zero-output retirement. The internal durable
runtime now installs the prepared manifest, commit catalog, and Worker Index atomically, retires the
old sources, and fails closed whenever restart must complete recovery. Explicit Store-level
scheduling is available through `Store::compact()`. An optional Store-owned
[MaintenanceController](maintenance-controller.md) (ADR 0023) may observe and schedule that primitive
under explicit modes and budgets. The single-output online kill/fault matrix is complete.
Multi-output recovery now covers partial replacement rollback and partial source retirement; the
differential online SIGKILL matrix covers every persistence transition unique to a second
replacement. An opt-in exhaustive profile covers every individual Record-copy occurrence.
An additional fixed-seed profile exercises randomized multi-output PUT/overwrite/ERASE/TTL
histories across old- and next-authority checkpoints. Native power-loss campaigns remain
certification work.

## Why the complete sealed history is one unit

Compacting one sealed Segment independently is unsafe. If it discards a tombstone while an older
put remains in another Segment, recovery can resurrect the deleted value. The same issue applies to
expired or superseded puts. One compaction transaction consequently selects every sealed Segment
owned by one Worker. The active Segment is never rewritten by that transaction.

The transaction copies only currently visible, non-expired puts whose `RecordRef` points into the
selected sealed set. Because every obsolete sealed Record for the Worker is retired together, no
discarded tombstone is needed to suppress a retained older value. Records are copied in increasing
sequence order and retain their v1 sequence, opcode, value type, flags, key hash, expiration, key,
and value.

## Identity and manifest plan

Outputs reuse the earliest source Segment IDs, increment their generations, remain sealed, and keep
their Worker owner. Surplus source entries disappear from the next manifest. The active entry,
`next_segment_id`, routing metadata, and every other Worker entry remain unchanged. This preserves
global Segment-ID ordering and keeps compacted sequence ranges before the Worker's active Segment
without changing Manifest, Segment, commit-slot, or Record v1 formats.

The planner rejects:

- a Worker without a sealed set or an output count larger than that set;
- exhausted manifest or selected Segment generations;
- plans that reclaim no physical Segment;
- temporary allocation, peak Store size, or physical write amplification outside
  `DurableResourceLimits`;
- a next manifest that does not pass the ordinary v1 encoder validation.

Physical write amplification is conservatively bounded as preallocated output Segment bytes divided
by Segment bytes reclaimed. Empty output is valid when the complete sealed history is obsolete.
Output sizing uses the exact sequence-ordered Record extents. Dividing aggregate live bytes by
Segment payload is only a lower bound because Records cannot span Segment boundaries; the builder
uses an allocation-free next-fit layout that also determines every future `RecordRef` before intent
publication. Peak Store accounting includes the output Segments, both external manifest files, and
both manifest payloads embedded in the intent.

## Publication and retirement protocol

The implementation must use this order:

```text
briefly lock target Worker + catalog
  -> copy owning Index entries and pin exact sealed generations
  -> release both locks
  -> collect and verify visible source Records
  -> prepare replacement Index publication without post-commit allocation
  -> create private replacement temporaries
  -> fill, synchronize, seal, and validate every replacement temporary
  -> acquire the old/next publication lease and revalidate the old Manifest
  -> publish and directory-sync an exact compaction intent
  -> rename every replacement temporary to its canonical identity
  -> directory sync once for the complete promoted name batch
  -> try-lock target Worker and lock catalog
  -> reject if sequence, batch, manifest, source identity, or pin changed
  -> prepare the complete non-allocating in-memory publication
  -> mark the target Worker commit-gated and release both locks
  -> atomically publish and directory-sync the next v1 Manifest with no mutex held
  -> re-lock, merge retained commit metadata, and publish prepared in-memory state
  -> clear the commit gate and release both locks
  -> unlink every old source name
  -> directory sync
  -> remove compaction intent
  -> directory sync
  -> final namespace audit
  -> release the old/next publication lease
```

The intent is protocol metadata, not a second data format. It must bind the Store ID, Worker,
previous and next manifest generations, and exact source/replacement identities with a checksum.
It is durable before any unlisted canonical replacement name can appear. Private
`.segment-<id>-<generation>.glypha.tmp` files may exist before the intent, but are never referenced
by the authoritative Manifest and are recognized only as disposable engine temporaries.

Before acquiring the lease and publishing that intent, the builder verifies the manifest snapshot,
validates
every snapshot Index reference against its catalog identity and routed source Record, drops expired
sealed source puts at the supplied Store time (counted in `expired_records_dropped`), and constructs
the complete replacement Index. It then creates, copies, seals and checksum-validates every output
under its private temporary name. Active-Segment Index entries are preserved by identity without a TTL
visit; those expired keys remain until lazy GET reclaim or the next recovery rebuild. Source
entries are ordered by their preserved sequence; one reusable Record buffer avoids per-read
allocation. Encoded v1 Record bytes are copied exactly into the planned Segment boundaries and
checked against exact record-count, extent, sequence, source CRC and output CRC metadata. The
placement vector holds a compact source-vector index instead of duplicating owning keys and
`RecordRef`s. Thus success requires no Index allocation after the future manifest commit. A
pre-intent failure removes private temporaries and remains `not_started`; a post-intent failure is
explicitly `recovery_required` and restart rolls exact temporary and canonical outputs back under
the old authority.

When automatic normal-pressure maintenance configures `max_copy_bytes_per_sec`, each private
replacement Record is emitted through allocation-free byte grants. Grants target 10 ms spacing and
bound every physical write to at most 1 MiB; Records larger than a grant are split only at the file-I/O
layer and remain one unchanged v1 Record. All waits occur before the publication lease and durable
intent. Pressure/emergency bypass pacing, and manual `Store::compact()` remains unpaced. The result
reports actual pacing wall delay, sleep count and burst bytes separately from total pre-intent time.

TTL reclaim has three cooperating paths: recovery omits expired latest puts from the rebuilt Index;
validated GET lazily removes Index/hot entries without a durable tombstone; sealed compaction drops
Index-resident expired puts from the replacement catalog and physically omits them from replacement
Segments. `Store::compact()` / `MaintenanceSnapshot` expose `expired_records_dropped` so operators
can measure sealed TTL reclaim independently of bytes/records copied.

The implemented intent codec stores the complete old and next v1 manifests under a fixed header
containing Store ID, Worker, both generations, exact payload lengths, format version, reserved-zero
space, and CRC32C. Decode validates both embedded manifests and reruns the canonical whole-Worker
transition validator; a header/payload disagreement, unknown version, trailing data, or a transition
that changes routing, active ownership, or next-ID state is rejected.

Filesystem publication writes a private exclusive temporary, synchronizes the complete intent,
renames it to the canonical name, and synchronizes the directory. Failures known to precede the
rename are `not_published` and clean the temporary; a rename attempt or later directory-sync failure
is `indeterminate` and poisons that `DataDirectory`. Reads validate a private singly linked regular
file, enforce the configured manifest-derived byte bound before allocating, read the exact stable
extent, and decode it. Intent removal distinguishes a fault before `unlinkat` (`not_removed`) from an
unlink attempt or subsequent directory-sync failure (`indeterminate`).

On restart, the runtime decodes and validates the intent before ordinary recovery, accepts only an
authoritative manifest exactly equal to its old or next manifest, and performs a complete recovery
scan of that authority before deleting anything. Namespace recovery admits only the canonical
intent and the exact non-authoritative Segment identities implied by the validated transition;
unrelated, malformed, linked, or missing authoritative entries still fail closed.

Recovery with an intent has only two valid authorities:

- if the old manifest is authoritative, all old sources must still exist; exact replacements named
  by the intent are rollback material and may be removed before the intent;
- if the next manifest is authoritative, every replacement must validate against it; remaining old
  sources are retirement material and may be removed before the intent;
- any other manifest generation, identity, missing authoritative file, or unrelated namespace entry
  fails closed without adoption.

Retirement opens every still-present obsolete name against its expected immutable identity before
unlinking. Missing obsolete names are accepted so recovery can resume after a partial cleanup. A
failure before the first unlink is `not_removed`; any failure after removal begins, including the
mandatory directory sync, is `indeterminate` and poisons that directory instance. A fresh reopen
repeats the same authoritative recovery, finishes the idempotent retirement batch, removes the
intent, and performs a final ordinary namespace audit.

No old source is unlinked before the new manifest and its directory entry are durable. `unlinkat`
is descriptor-relative. A cold reader carries shared ownership of the exact immutable generation
and its already-open descriptor; source retirement can remove the pathname after publication without
invalidating that reader. Its final locked validation observes the replacement `RecordRef`/pin and
retries before returning. The directory is synchronized after the retirement batch so restart
observes either names still awaiting cleanup or their durable removal.

## Cooperative scheduling policy

Compaction must not run in a mutation or acknowledgement critical path. The implemented internal
`compact_worker` takes a brief owning snapshot, then performs source reads, CRC validation,
replacement writes, sealing, and reopen validation without the target Worker or catalog lock. On the
mutex-elided exclusive Writer path, Phase A arms the Worker-local `compaction_commit_active` gate and
waits for `hot_path_depth == 0` before enumerating the Index (shared catalog lock alone does not
serialize exclusive mutates that skip `worker.mutex`); the gate is cleared before Phase B so ordinary
mutations continue during the unlocked build. Reads and ordinary mutations continue on that Worker
during Phase B. A mutation wins publication: sequence/batch drift
causes a finite `sequence_conflict`, durable removal of replacement files and intent under the still
authoritative old manifest, and no fail-close unless rollback itself becomes uncertain. Publication
uses a non-waiting Worker try-lock and the catalog-exclusive lock only to validate and prepare
already-reserved vectors. It then installs a Worker-local logical commit gate and releases every
physical mutex before quiesce waits and the durable manifest write, sync, rename, and directory
sync. On the mutex-elided exclusive Writer path it waits for `hot_path_depth == 0` (and otherwise
for `!mutation_io_active`) only after that unlock, then reacquires the locks and revalidates
sequence / batch / source pins; drift aborts with finite `sequence_conflict` and rolls back
replacements under the old authority — holding catalog across the depth wait would deadlock a
mutate that already entered the hot path and needs shared catalog after append. Reads continue
through the old Index and pinned sources. Mutations on that Worker receive a finite
`sequence_conflict`; flush paths wait on a condition variable that releases the Worker mutex.
After durable publication, the runtime reacquires the locks, refreshes retained commit metadata
that other Workers may have advanced, performs the allocation-free in-memory switch, and clears
the gate. Source retirement and final audit also run unlocked.

Persistence v1 admits exactly the old and next manifest authorities. A Store-wide logical
publication lease preserves that invariant without holding the publication mutex itself through
intent installation, promotion, manifest I/O, or retirement. Crucially, ADR 0039 keeps source scan,
replacement creation, Record copy, output synchronization, seal and validation outside even the
logical lease. Rotation and a second compaction take the physical serializer only long enough to
observe the lease. A second compaction returns a
finite `sequence_conflict`; rotation snapshots its Worker sequence, releases the Worker mutex while
waiting on the condition variable, then revalidates both sequence and authority. If another mutation
advanced that Worker, the suspended attempt returns `not_committed + sequence_conflict`; the daemon
may retry the same owned mutation once, while the embedded API reports the conflict. This prevents
the lease wait from becoming equivalent Worker head-of-line blocking and still forbids a third
manifest authority. This keeps persistence v1 unchanged.

`CompactionResult` separates `pre_intent_duration_ns` from
`publication_lease_duration_ns`. It also reports
`pacing_delay_ns`, `pacing_sleep_count`, `pacing_burst_bytes`, and
`transient_metadata_lower_bound_bytes`, which includes source/placement vector capacity, replacement
Index table and arena bytes, and reusable Record scratch. This is not an RSS claim: copied
`std::string` heap storage and allocator bookkeeping require a platform allocation census.
Write-amplification and temporary-space budgets (`DurableResourceLimits`) are enforced at plan time
before any durable intent (`GS-PERSIST-AMP-001`). Maintenance latency/reclaim debt and pacing
telemetry (`GS-OPS-DEBT-001`) are diagnostic observability; they do **not** retire ADR 0036
generation-slot-pool publication obligations.

The public `Store::compact()` scheduler is cooperative and creates no background thread by itself.
It examines eligible Workers in round-robin order, skips exact layouts that would reclaim no physical
Segment, and completes at most one transaction per call under the configured temporary-space and
amplification limits. A Store-local try-lock rejects a concurrent maintenance request instead of
queuing it. This bounds shutdown: `close()` either sees no compaction or waits only for the one
already admitted transaction to finish.

Benefit/cost validation for high/medium/low reclaim, copy-heavy, TTL, and no-gain layouts runs
through the compaction/maintenance harnesses under gitignored `benchmark-results*/`. Foreground
tail latency, controlled cross-platform runs, and automatic-policy tuning remain release work.

When `StoreConfig::maintenance.mode` is `background`, a Store-owned
[MaintenanceController](maintenance-controller.md) may run one evaluation thread and invoke
`Store::compact()` under Phase 1 normal-policy budgets. The controller shares the same non-queuing
maintenance gate.

## Required evidence

The process-kill matrix now addresses intent publication, each of two replacement writes, the batched
Record sync, both commit-slot publications (data boundary and seal), replacement rename, manifest
publication, both source unlinks, intent removal, and all five directory-sync occurrences. Every case
reopens through the ordinary recovery entry point, preserves both values, and verifies the rebuilt
Index. A complementary pre-operation I/O-fault matrix covers the same 24 boundaries and checks both
runtime outcome/health and clean reopen. Allocator interposition enumerates every allocation observed
by the online transaction and reopens after each failure. Existing tests also cover tombstone
non-resurrection, TTL reclamation, zero-output compaction, generation/resource limits, and repeated
compaction. An online end-to-end case compacts 64 maximum-size live Records from three sealed
sources into exactly two replacements, verifies every rebuilt reference, and reopens every value.
Four independent fixed-seed histories apply 608 total PUT/ERASE/expiring-PUT operations across 32
keys, three sealed sources, and the active Segment; each sequential model must agree before
compaction, after in-memory installation, and after ordinary reopen. A failure reports the exact
reproduction seed. Five additional seeds combine another 760 operations with occurrence-specific
I/O failure before intent write, during the third Record copy, at Manifest synchronization, during
the second source unlink, and before intent removal. Each case verifies the returned outcome,
healthy/fail-closed state, selected old/next authority, clean namespace, and the same model after
reopen.
Two-output recovery additionally injects a failure and SIGKILL after each partial replacement
rollback and partial source retirement position, then proves idempotent cleanup of every remaining
identity. Rollback removes both the canonical and partially created temporary name for each obsolete
replacement identity, including a crash during creation of the second output. The single-output
online SIGKILL scenario now seeds a fixed 30-operation
PUT/ERASE/expiring-PUT history across two sealed sources and the active Segment; the same eight-key
model must survive every one of its 24 persistence checkpoints. A complementary 14-checkpoint
online 3-to-2 scenario covers the transitions not present in that single-output transaction:
second-replacement preallocation/header/promotion, its batched directory sync, the final of 64 maximum-size
Record writes, its distinct data and seal commits, the shifted Manifest/retirement/intent directory
syncs, and the third source unlink. The separate `copy-matrix` kills after each of the other 63
Record writes, so the two profiles cover every one of the 64 copies and 152 distinct checkpoints in
total. The source seed batches pending Records and makes them durable at seal so exhaustive evidence
does not add a sync per seed Record. The `random-matrix` adds four reproducible 96-operation
histories, each combining PUT, overwrite, ERASE, expired PUT, and restoration while retaining
exactly 64 maximum-size live values. It SIGKILL-tests nine checkpoint classes per seed: durable
intent, early/middle/final copy, second-output creation and seal, Manifest authority change,
partial source retirement, and final cleanup. Native power-loss evidence remains before P0-08 can
be certified across all supported platforms. A separate bounded `random-campaign` samples a new
history seed and checkpoint class per iteration from one recorded campaign seed, reopens against the
same complete sequential oracle, and emits a TSV schedule/outcome report. The hosted weekly profile
runs 256 cases; local or dedicated-runner campaigns may request up to 10,000. This broadens E2
state-space sampling but is neither random-timing coverage nor E3/E4 certification.
