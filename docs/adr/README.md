# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs preserve why a durable architectural choice was made. They are historical records, not mutable
implementation guides.

## Lifecycle

Allowed statuses are:

- `proposed`: under review and not authoritative;
- `accepted`: authoritative unless superseded;
- `amended`: still authoritative together with named later ADRs;
- `superseded`: retained for history but no longer governs new work;
- `rejected`: considered and deliberately not selected;
- `deprecated`: still implemented temporarily but scheduled for removal.

An accepted ADR is never silently rewritten to pretend a later decision existed. Add `Amended by`,
`Superseded by`, or a new consequences section that clearly identifies the later decision.

## Required structure

Use [template.md](template.md). Every new ADR must describe context, decision drivers, considered
alternatives, decision, consequences, compatibility impact, verification, and relationships.

Official TCP client error taxonomy, automatic retries, and deadline behavior are governed by
[ADR 0019](0019-client-error-retry-timeout.md) and [client semantics v1](../spec/client-semantics-v1.md).
Embedded Store `ErrorCode` values remain a separate surface.

Secure network profile (TLS / mTLS / capabilities) is governed by
[ADR 0020](0020-tls-outer-transport.md), [ADR 0021](0021-secure-profile-authentication.md),
[ADR 0022](0022-authorization-capabilities.md), [ADR 0025](0025-key-prefix-tenant-scope.md),
[ADR 0026](0026-keyed-index-hash-seed.md), [ADR 0027](0027-stats-isolation-prefix-principals.md), and
[ADR 0029](0029-uds-peercred.md);
implementation order is in [security roadmap](../security/roadmap.md).
