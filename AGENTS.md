# Agent guidance for GlyphaStore

GlyphaStore is an **architectural prototype**. Do not claim production readiness,
alpha/beta/stable closure, E3/E4 durability certification, or “ready for hostile
public deployment” unless the corresponding quality gates in `engineering/gates/`
are in `PROVATA_IN_CI` / `ACCETTATA_PER_RILASCIO` with existing evidence paths.

## Guiding principle

A promise is credible only when it is the conjunction of:

1. a machine-readable **requirement** (`engineering/requirements/`);
2. a normative **specification** or accepted ADR (`docs/spec/`, `docs/adr/`);
3. an **implementation** that matches the contract;
4. automated **proofs** (tests, fuzz, crash, matrices);
5. retained **evidence** (CI artifacts, campaign records under `engineering/evidence/`);
6. an explicit **residual risk** (including hazards in `engineering/hazards/`).

Design text or code presence alone never closes a gate.

## Non-negotiables

- C++23; CMake ≥ 3.25.
- Persistence format **v1** and wire protocol **v2** unless an ADR explicitly versions a change.
- Official runtime: paired Reader–Writer shard pairs (ADR 0031/0032); no silent dual-runtime.
- Partition ownership, immutable read generations, bounded lanes, fail-closed recovery.
- No unbounded client-controlled work; no raw owning `new`/`delete` in production paths.
- No persisted struct casts; explicit little-endian codecs (`include/glyphastore/core/little_endian.hpp`);
  checked size/offset/capacity arithmetic.
- macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD remain in documented scope; durability claims are
  platform-row specific (see platform durability evidence matrix).

## Silent-change ban

Do not silently change acknowledgement points, persistent write ordering, Manifest authority,
routing, tombstone/erase semantics, mutation visibility, borrow lifetimes, recovery behavior,
on-disk/wire compatibility, or official client observable outcomes. Such changes require a new
or updated ADR plus linked requirements, proofs, and evidence.

## Assurance system

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/assurance/engineering-baseline.md`](docs/assurance/engineering-baseline.md) | Gap recon and Phase A baseline |
| [`engineering/`](engineering/) | Authority for requirements, hazards, gates, waivers, claims |
| [`engineering/tools/validate_assurance.py`](engineering/tools/validate_assurance.py) | Schema + referential integrity + CI gate |
| [`docs/production-readiness.md`](docs/production-readiness.md) | **Generated** view of gates (do not edit by hand) |

Run locally:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user PyYAML jsonschema
python3 engineering/tools/validate_assurance.py
python3 engineering/tools/validate_assurance.py --write-generated
```

## Change discipline

Use Conventional Commits. Prefer one purpose per commit. Update requirements/gates/hazards when
behavior or evidence changes. Keep README status as architectural prototype until gates justify
otherwise.
